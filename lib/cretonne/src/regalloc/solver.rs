//! Constraint solver for register coloring.
//!
//! The coloring phase of SSA-based register allocation is very simple in theory, but in practice
//! it is complicated by the various constraints imposed by individual instructions:
//!
//! - Call and return instructions have to satisfy ABI requirements for arguments and return
//!   values.
//! - Values live across a call must be in a callee-saved register.
//! - Some instructions have operand constraints such as register sub-classes, fixed registers, or
//!   tied operands.
//!
//! # The instruction register coloring problem
//!
//! The constraint solver addresses the problem of satisfying the constraints of a single
//! instruction. We have:
//!
//! - A set of values that are live in registers before the instruction, with current register
//!   assignments. Some are used by the instruction, some are not.
//! - A subset of the live register values that are killed by the instruction.
//! - A set of new register values that are defined by the instruction.
//!
//! We are not concerned with stack values at all. The reload pass ensures that all values required
//! to be in a register by the instruction are already in a register.
//!
//! A solution to the register coloring problem consists of:
//!
//! - Register reassignment prescriptions for a subset of the live register values.
//! - Register assignments for the instruction's defined values.
//!
//! The solution ensures that when live registers are reassigned as prescribed before the
//! instruction, all its operand constraints are satisfied, and the definition assignments won't
//! conflict.
//!
//! # Register diversions and global interference
//!
//! We can divert register values temporarily to satisfy constraints, but we need to put the
//! values back into their originally assigned register locations before leaving the EBB.
//! Otherwise, values won't be in the right register at the entry point of other EBBs.
//!
//! Some values are *local*, and we don't need to worry about putting those values back since they
//! are not used in any other EBBs.
//!
//! When we assign register locations to defines, we are assigning both the register used locally
//! immediately after the instruction and the register used globally when the defined value is used
//! in a different EBB. We need to avoid interference both locally at the instruction and globally.
//!
//! We have multiple mappings of values to registers:
//!
//! 1. The initial local mapping before the instruction. This includes any diversions from previous
//!    instructions in the EBB, but not diversions for the current instruction.
//! 2. The local mapping after applying the additional reassignments required to satisfy the
//!    constraints of the current instruction.
//! 3. The local mapping after the instruction. This excludes values killed by the instruction and
//!    includes values defined by the instruction.
//! 4. The global mapping after the instruction. This mapping only contains values with global live
//!    ranges, and it does not include any diversions.
//!
//! All four mappings must be kept free of interference.
//!
//! # Problems handled by previous passes.
//!
//! The constraint solver can only reassign registers, it can't create spill code, so some
//! constraints are handled by earlier passes:
//!
//! - There will be enough free registers available for the defines. Ensuring this is the primary
//!   purpose of the spilling phase.
//! - When the same value is used for multiple operands, the intersection of operand constraints is
//!   non-empty. The spilling phase will insert copies to handle mutually incompatible constraints,
//!   such as when the same value is bound to two different function arguments.
//! - Values bound to tied operands must be killed by the instruction. Also enforced by the
//!   spiller.
//! - Values used by register operands are in registers, and values used by stack operands are in
//!   stack slots. This is enforced by the reload pass.
//!
//! # Solver algorithm
//!
//! The goal of the solver is to satisfy the instruction constraints with a minimal number of
//! register assignments before the instruction.
//!
//! 1. Compute the set of values used by operands with a fixed register constraint that isn't
//!    already satisfied. These are mandatory predetermined reassignments.
//! 2. Compute the set of values that don't satisfy their register class constraint. These are
//!    mandatory reassignments that we need to solve.
//! 3. Add the set of defines to the set of variables computed in 2. Exclude defines tied to an
//!    input operand since their value is pre-determined.
//!
//! The set of values computed in 2. and 3. are the *variables* for the solver. Given a set of
//! variables, we can also compute a set of allocatable registers by removing the variables from
//! the set of assigned registers before the instruction.
//!
//! 1. For each variable, compute its domain as the intersection of the allocatable registers and
//!    its register class constraint.
//! 2. Sort the variables in order of increasing domain size.
//! 3. Search for a solution that assigns each variable a register from its domain without
//!    interference between variables.
//!
//! If the search fails to find a solution, we may need to reassign more registers. Find an
//! appropriate candidate among the set of live register values, add it as a variable and start
//! over.
