# It is a goal of the cranelift-codegen crate to have minimal external dependencies.
# Please don't add any unless they are essential to the task of creating binary
# machine code. Integration tests that need external dependencies can be
# accomodated in `tests`.

# The "std" feature enables use of libstd. The "core" feature enables use
